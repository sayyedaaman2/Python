# Iterables = An object/collection that can return its elements one at a time,
#               allowing to to be itereated over in a loop


# List

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]


# for num in (numbers):
#     print(num, end=" ")
    
# for num in reversed(numbers):
#     print(num, end=" ")

# Tuple

# numbers = (1,2,3,4,5)


# for num in (numbers):
#     print(num, end=" ")
    
# print()
# for num in reversed(numbers):
#     print(num, end=" ")

# Sets

# fruits = {"apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"}

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# # set object is not reversible
# for fruit in reversed(fruits):
#     print(fruit)


# String

# name = "Bro Code"

# for character in name:
#     print(character,end=" ")

# Dictionary 

# my_dictionary = {"A": 1, "B":2, "C":3}

# for key in my_dictionary:
#     print(f"key : {key}")

# for value in my_dictionary.values():
#     print(f"value : {value}")

# for key,value in my_dictionary.items():
#     print(f"key:{key},value:{value}")
